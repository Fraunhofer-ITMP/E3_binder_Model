# E3_binder_Model
Model based on E3Binder list from Protac-DB/ProtacPedia and Evolvus. Under **data** folder R script is found together with three data files containing structural details of molecules used for selectivtiy modeling. **Asinex library** can be found also [here](https://www.asinex.com/protein-degradation). **Broad library version 2018** used can be found [here](https://clue.io/repurposing#download-data).
**R script** has been setup with RStudio v.1.21335 and R v.3.6.1 All libraries used in R are cited in the script.

Due to licensing restrictions of Evolvus data, we have removed smiles notation from the file. However, ErG description can be still used to rerun script and predictions.
**ErG Script** can be found in original format as MOE SVL script [here](https://svl.chemcomp.com/) and searching for keyword "Reduced" or as RDkit fingeprint scheme [here](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html)
