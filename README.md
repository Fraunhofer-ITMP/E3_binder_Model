# E3_binder_Model
Analogue to Molecular Gluer Model but based on E3Binder list from Protac-DB/ProtacPedia and Evolvus. The dataset of E3 Ligase Binders is more numerous than Molecular Glue, but the negatively active molecules (NonE3binder) have been similarly chosen.

Due to licensing restrictions of Evolvus data, we are working our way to make the data asap.

Manuscript submitted. Pre-print to be available soon!
