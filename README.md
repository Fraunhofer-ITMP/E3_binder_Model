# E3_binder_Model
Analogue to Molecular Gluer Model but based on E3Binder list from Protac-DB/ProtacPedia and Evolvus. The dataset of E3 Ligase Binders is more numerous than Molecular Glue, but the negatively active molecules (NonE3binder) have been similarly chosen.
Pre-print to be available soon!
